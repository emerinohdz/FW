FW v0.1
Ferm based framework


FW is a framework based in FERM (http://ferm.foo-projects.org/) that
aims to simplify even further the creation and organization of linux
firewalls.

It consists of a small API for defining rules and a filesystem hierarchy
to manage firewalls, as well as modules, tools and one single entry point:
firewall.ferm. 

The main entry point, firewall.ferm, defines default policies for the 3
different chains in the filter table, allows local incoming traffic and
loads activated modules.

In FW, each firewall (set of rules) is considered a MODULE, and these can 
be activated/deactivated by setting the executable flag in the module file.
Each module can be tested individually.

Only one tool is included at this time, and it's a SH script that helps
in deciding which modules are activated.

The API can be used standalone, and is divided into tree components:

	lang.ferm:		Defines aliases and actions for rule creation.
	route.ferm:		Defines routing functions for rule creation.
	protocols.ferm: Defines actions for well known protocols.

For FW to work, you need to unpack it under the directory /etc/ferm.d
(although this can be changed is not recommended).
